#  Runs ONCE during system shutdown on the TARGET VM (AI server) (via systemd).
#  POSTs to the bot VM's /notify/stopping endpoint.
#
#  This catches ALL shutdown types:
#    - Manual stop via GCP Console
#    - gcloud compute instances stop
#    - sudo shutdown / sudo poweroff
#    - GCP Spot preemption (preemption-watcher also fires — that's fine)
#
#  The companion systemd service uses ExecStop= to trigger this script
#  when the system is shutting down.
